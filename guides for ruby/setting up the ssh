setting up the ssh
type: git
type: ssh-keygen
type: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
copy the ssh-rsa (everything)
go to your github and go to settings -> SSH and GPG keys tab -> click new SSH key
create a title and paste the copied ssh-rsa to key input box then save
create a new repo in github but don't add a readme file
in your newly created repo, copy the ssh. NOT the https.
go back to your terminal and create a new folder

cd to that folder and type: git init
you must see initialized empty git repository etc.. or reinitialized exisiting Git etc..
type: git remote add origin <copied ssh> then enter
create files on that folder by using touch or go to vscode by typing code . (dot)
-now you can create a project, once done
go back to your terminal and:
type git status
type git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master
